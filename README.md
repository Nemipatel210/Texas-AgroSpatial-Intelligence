## 📖 Project Overview

**Texas-AgroSpatial-Intelligence** is a data science initiative designed to explore the relationship between agricultural output and groundwater resources in Texas. Given the state's heavy reliance on irrigation and vast geographical diversity, understanding the spatial distribution of wells and crop metrics is crucial for sustainable resource management.

This project utilizes Python-based GIS tools to clean, analyze, and visualize complex spatial datasets, providing interactive insights into the agricultural landscape of Texas.

## 🔑 Key Features

* **Geospatial Analysis of Wells:** In-depth analysis of water well density and distribution using Texas GIS data.
* **Thematic Mapping:** creation of Choropleth maps to visualize agricultural metrics (e.g., crop yield, irrigation intensity) across different counties.
* **Interactive Visualizations:** Dynamic maps rendered with **Folium** allowing users to zoom and inspect specific regions or data points.
* **Statistical EDA:** Exploratory Data Analysis using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to identify correlations between well depth, water availability, and agricultural types.
* **3D/Advanced Plotting:** Utilization of **Plotly** for high-dimensional data visualization.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The project is built entirely in **Python** using the following libraries:

* **Data Manipulation:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`
* **Geospatial Analysis:** `GeoPandas`, `Shapely`
* **Visualization:** `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`
* **Mapping:** `Folium`, `Contextily`

## 📂 Data Sources

The analysis relies on public datasets including:
* **Texas Water Development Board (TWDB):** Groundwater database and well location shapefiles.
* **USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS):** County-level agricultural data.
* **TNRIS (Texas Natural Resources Information System):** Base GIS layers for Texas counties and administrative boundaries.
